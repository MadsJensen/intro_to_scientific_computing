# Metaphors for computer and software

* RAM: short term memory
* Hard drive: Long term memory
* Variables: different types of shopping bags
    * One is good for frozen & wet items, another is good for vegetables
    * sometimes you have to tell the computer what your bag is going to contain ("compiled" programming languages)
    * in "interpreted" (dynamic) programming languages, you can change the type of bag simply by placing something else into it!
    * each bag has a name that you give it--good idea to use descriptive names so you remember what you put into it!
