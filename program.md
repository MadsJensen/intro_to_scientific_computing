# Program: Foundations of data-driven health science

Teaching is in the form of "interactive lectures", where students follow 
instructions to complete specific learning tasks introduced by the lecturers. 

## Dates

Three days of teaching (Mon, Wed, Fri), possible starting dates:
* Mon 4 September (week 36)
* Mon 11 September (week 37)

## Timetable

Each day from 9 am to 4 pm, with following breaks:

* 10:15 - 10:30
* 12:00 - 12:30 (Lunch)
* 14:14 - 14:30

## Content

[//]: # (Thought: Maybe it would be good to talk about "pipes" as a metaphor for linking functions.)

[//]: # (NB: below is likely to change order when we start writing the exercises!)

### Day 1: The anatomy of a computer and data

* How are storage and computation achieved in modern computing devices?
* Terminal & Bash: telling the computer what to do (one of many "languages")
* Textual vs. binary files
* File system(s)
* Interactive development vs. scripts
* Introduction to variables and memory

### Day 2: The anatomy and building blocks of a program

* Variable types and manipulations
* Basic control flow
* Memory usage
* Introduction to programming exercise

[//]: # (General: assessment of resource usage associated with task/variable)

### Day 3: Programming to gain insight into data

* Functions
* Arithmetic
* Efficient manipulation of large textual data blocks
* Examples and suggestions for further study

[//]: # (Programming language choices, resources, visualisation, stats)

[//]: # (The following should probably be moved to the beginning of the notebook "Exx-Parsing_Logfile.ipynb")

### Programming exercise: extracting information from log files

* Event: target (in samples).
* Reaction: button press (in samples).
* Calculate reaction time in ms.
* Export in long format.
