    ">Conda is an open source ___package___ management system ___and environment management___ system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their ___dependencies___. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language.\n",

    "## Why do we want it?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are learning about computing, for which we will need to write [programs](computer-programs-and-data-types.ipynb). The specific language we will use for demonstrations and exercises is called [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language). We use `conda` to ease the pain of installing and operating a Python-based programming environment on all 3 OS's. Much of the said 'pain' arises due to _interdependencies_: some software modules/packages _depend_ on others being present. This can quickly become very complicated without a tool like `conda`...\n",

    "\n",

It's a hefty >400 MB download.\n",
