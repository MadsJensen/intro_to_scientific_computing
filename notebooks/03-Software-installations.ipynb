    ">Conda is an open source ___package___ management system ___and environment management___ system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their ___dependencies___. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language.\n",

The specific language we will use for demonstrations and exercises is called [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language). We use `conda` to ease the pain of installing and operating a Python-based programming environment on all 3 OS's. Much of the said 'pain' arises due to _interdependencies_: some software modules/packages _depend_ on others being present. This can quickly become very complicated without a tool like `conda`...\n",
