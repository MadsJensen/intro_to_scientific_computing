    "We are interested in the _mean and median reaction times_ (RT) and _accuracies_ of the subjects in the study. The RT of a single _trial_ is simply the time between the presentation of a stimulus, and the response. Accuracy describes how many percent of all of the responses given by the subject were correct. \n",
