    "# Files are organised into [file systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system)\n",
    "\n",
    ">In computing, a file system or filesystem is used to control how data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, information placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of information stops and the next begins. By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the information is easily isolated and identified. Taking its name from the way paper-based information systems are named, each group of data is called a \"file\". The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of information and their names is called a \"file system\". _(Wikipedia)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The OS takes care of interacting with the file system when the user issues a command to, _e.g._, read or write (to) a file. The user can therefore remain agnostic as to the _physical location_ on the storage medium of the data you are accessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of file systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different types of file systems exist, each with their use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Disk file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system#Disk_file_systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common type a user will be confronted with. As the name implies, disk file systems are used on the storage media physically connected to a computer, such as the internal hard drive, and USB thumb drive (or other removable medium). Examples of disk file systems include\n",
    "\n",
    "* NTFS (Windows)\n",
    "* HFS+ (Mac OS Extended)\n",
    "* ext4 (Linux)\n",
    "* FAT/exFAT\n",
    "* ISO 9660 (CD/DVD disk)\n",
    "\n",
    "The common scenario in which a user will experience file system-related problems is when trying to use a USB thumb drive initialised on one OS (_e.g._ Windows) on another (_e.g._ Mac): _unless the OS includes 'drivers' for a specific file systen, it will not be able to read the data on it_. In some cases, reading may be possible, but not writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hint:__ Use the exFAT file system for USB drives, this will make it possible to read from and write to them on both Windows and Mac hosts (though not Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialisation of a disk file system: [partitioning and formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_formatting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an 'empty' 16GB USB drive, in which all bits are zero (this is an extremely unlikely scenario, but the point is: its has 'nothing' on it). The first thing to do is to define _partitions_ on the physical disk. Consider these the hard boundaries outside which files cannot be written. On personal computers, it is common to have a single large partition for the OS and all user files. However, several 'hidden' partitions typically exist too, related to the initial startup (_boot_) process of the OS, and the possibility to _'recover'_ from certain unwanted situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a physical disk is partitioned, it needs to be _formatted_: this is the point at which a file system is initialised and the partition can be referred to by a name (_e.g._ \"C:\" on Windows or \"Macintosh HD\" on Mac). \n",
    "\n",
    "### [Network file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system#Network_file_systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "A common data science scenario is that of a centralised server infrastructure on which data is stored. Although at the server-level, physical disks are partitioned and file systems initialised on them just as on our PCs, we the users cannot directly access the remote disks. Instead, the server makes some specific location (_e.g._ directory) on its drives available on the local network. This is done using one of many _access protocols_: usually a user needs to _authenticate_ herself before access is granted by providing a valid username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the point of view of access, network file systems have changes the way people use devices. Using one of the many (free and non-free) 'syncing' services, we can have access to a file regardless of which device we are currently using. Privacy and data-security issues are only beginning to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of working on data, _e.g._ in health science, the large size of many datasets necessitates the use of high-capacity servers for performing analyses. Another reason for the need for remote data access and processing is related to data security: patient data must never be compromised by moving it out of secure server environments. Our data is therefore often non-local, which may have implications on how we can interact with it. For example, whereas data can be read into memory from a modern SSD hard drive at rates of hundreds of megabytes per second, transfer over a network may be _two orders of magnitude slower_."
