    "**Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols.

Programming languges differ greatly in both the specific form of the tokens used and the structures they may form.  \n",

Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter.

Comments are portions of the _code_ that are not **parsed** by either the interpreter or the compiler, _i.e._, these are “left out” from the translation to machine instructions. Comments are thus exempt of syntax-checking and meaning-parsing applied to all other code.  \n",
