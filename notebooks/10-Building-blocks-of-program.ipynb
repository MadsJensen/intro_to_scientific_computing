    "\n",
    "The first step towards gaining access to your data is being able to read it into memory. Writing subsets of processed results out to disk is often preferrable to performing an entire analysis in one shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptually\n",
    "\n",
    "When we list (`ls`) and `find` files in the file system, we are referring to the _names of the data containers_. For reading the contents of an _existing_ file, we must ask the OS to ___open the file for reading___. When instead we wish to write to file _with a specific name_, we must ask the OS to ___open the file for writing___ (possibly _creating the file_, if one did not already exist). We can also ___open the file for appending___.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we're done with I/O-operations on a file, ___we must remember to close it___.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "Each language has its own syntax for file I/O, but the basic idiom is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. open a file ('r', 'w', or 'a'), receive a _file pointer_ in the process\n",
    "2. read from or write to the file pointer\n",
    "3. close the file pointer, thus closing the file I/O-process\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function `open` opens a file, and returns a file pointer object to it. The pointer has methods for reading/writing, and a `close`-method for finishing up.\n",
    "\n",
    "(_Matlab has a slightly different syntax, but the ideas are the same._)"

    "## Functions  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\"In the context of programming, a **function** is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can 'call' the function by name.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function, runs the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to run the statements in another function. Then, while running that new function, the program might have to run yet another function!  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In summary, when you read a program, you don’t always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you follow the flow of execution.” (Downey, 2015; Chapter 3)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Arguments  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions just do their 'thing', but most take _input arguments_. These can either be in the form of _parameters_ that modify what the function actually does, and/or in the form of _data to operate on_. (This is merely a conceptual distinction: parameters are also a form of data, of course!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why functions?  \n",
    "  \n",
    "But is there a deeper point/advantage in using functions instead of just writing out the code you want to have executed? One reason is that:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug. [and] Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write [...] one, you can reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third example relates to efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.” (Downey, 2015)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Defining functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a function can be used in a programme, it must be _defined_. In the Python-language, this is achieved using the `def` keyword, arguments in parentheses and a colon (:)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def a_new_function(param1, param2, meaningful_name=2):\n",
    "    code...\n",
    "    return(return_value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In another common interpreted language, _Matlab_, the keyword to use is `function`, and the value of the variable `return_value` must be set in the code\n",
    "\n",
    "```Matlab\n",
    "function return_value = a_new_function(param1, param2, param3)\n",
    "    code...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: the book price from Tuesday\n",
