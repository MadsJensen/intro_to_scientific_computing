    "Programming is a distinctly different activity from writing in a word processor or entering values into a spreadsheet. Besides the obvious distinction (someone needed to program the applications you use for those tasks), when you are \"using\" a computer, you are operating within the bounds of whatever the program was designed to do (as a counter-example, try adding two values together in Word...). On the contrary, a _programmer_ designs new applications for specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now \"programmer\" may seem like a mouthful, but for there is no ready-made application for _data-driven health science_! And even within the specialities (_e.g._ genetic sequencing), only in very few cases can you hope to double-click on a data file and have something reasonable happen. Instead, it is up to you as the domain-expert to guide the flow of bits in order to gain insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is not a monolithic concept, it can mean a bunch of things. In this course we will be dealing with what could be described as _high-level_ programming, which has the characteristic of being quite abstract with respect to the underlying hardware implementing the programs. In other words, we will leave as much as the _low-level_ hardware optimisation to the \"real\" programmers as possible, and instead focus on learning how to join together existing _routines_ for implementing specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned [above](what-is-a-computer.ipynb), this by no means implies that we can treat the computer as a black box! Ultimately, it is up to you to ensure that the operations that you line up are _reasonable_ with respect to the specifications of the computers performing them (especially: CPU time and memory requirements)."
