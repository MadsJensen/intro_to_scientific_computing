# ToDos #

- [ ] Complete the course description.
- [ ] Write graduate school.
- [ ] Look at jupyter notebook slides
- [ ] Create a github-webpage for course (?!)


# Software to look into #

* [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) for automatic assignment checking
* [nbdime](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime) for notebook diffs and merges

## Miniconda ##

Use miniconda to install standardised environment, containing
* a terminal emulator (for file system access)
* a python(3)-distribution for learning basic programming concepts
* a text editor with code highlighting
* a console and/or notebook environment for interactive use (REPL)

## Jupyterlab ##

__Consider [jupyterlab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)!__
* "alpha preview" state, but rapidly developing
* has all the components above, can be arranged IDE-like on screen
* has csv-, md-, etc. -renderers for viewing ascii file contents in "pretty form"

[//]: # (MJ: I agree that jupyterlab is worth using, even in present state)
