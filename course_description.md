# Introduction to scientific computing

[//]: # (Course [github repo](https://github.com/MadsJensen/intro_to_scientific_computing).)

## Aims ##
To provide students with a basic understanding of what is meant by the term "scientific computing" and how it can be implemented in practice. Such an understanding is the basis for learning a programming language and make reproducible data analyses. Further, it will provide the students with valuable tools to either continue on another, more advanced, programming course, or self-studies.

[//]: # (_Add a few more general aims and motivations, but already pretty good._)
[//]: # (MJ: Aren't the aims done?)


## Learning outcomes

[//]: # (_Define according to Bloom's Taxonomy (or similar)_, _cf._ ILOs.pdf)

Successful completion of the course will enable the student to:

* Summarize the main components of a computer and relate these to the process of "computing"
[//]: # (    * NB: storage, memory, CPU, (GPU), input devices, output devices, network)
* Contrast _textual_ and _binary_ files in terms of their contents and find information in both using tools that can be automated
* Contrast "local" and "network" file systems and formulate use cases for both
[//]: # (    * NB: could be of relevance if talking about large files processed on a remote server)
* Use _variables_ in a programming language (python) and perform simple operations (manipulations) on the information (data) they contain
* Write a program to extract information from a file containing data in textual format, and export the collated data to another text file for further processing (statistics, visualisation)
[//]: # (     * MJ: visualization might be to advanced. CJB: agreed)


## Content
The course runs over three days:

[//]: # (Thought: Maybe it would be good to talk about "pipes" as a metaphor for linking functions.)

[//]: # (NB: below is likely to change order when we start writing the exercises!)

**Day 1:**

* What is a computer?
* Terminal & Bash
* Textual vs. binary files
* File system(s)
* Interactive development vs. scripts
* Introduction to variables and memory

**Day 2:**

* Variable types and manipulations
* Basic control flow
* Memory usage
[//]: # (General: assessment of resource usage associated with task/variable)
* Introduction to programming exercise

**Day 3:**

* Functions
* Arithmetic
* Log file exercise
* Examples and suggestions for further study
[//]: # (Programming language choices, resources, visualisation, stats)

[//]: # (The following should probably be moved to the beginning of the notebook "Exx-Parsing_Logfile.ipynb")

**Programming exercise: extracting information from log files:**

* Event: target (in samples).
* Reaction: button press (in samples).
* Calculate reaction time in ms.
* Export in long format.


### Prerequisites

Participants must bring their own laptop with a hard drive (no Chromebooks or tablet-/surface-type devices are supported). Any reasonably modern (< 5-year-old) Windows, OS X or Linux operating system will do.

### Teaching format

Lectures (few) and (mostly) hands-on exercises.

### Target audience

* Students of any discipline that generates or work with _data_ that needs to be analysed to gain insight into a phenomenon (_a.k.a._ "everybody")
* People interested in the foundations of data-driven science

### Course material

Will be provided before the beginning of course.

### Language

English

### Involvement/Evaluation

The course alternates between short lectures and hands-on computational problems

### ECTS
To be determined by HEALTH
[//]: # (MJ: isn't this calculated based on the hours the course takes?)

### Criteria for participation

University degree in medicine, dentistry, nursing, or Master's degree in other fields and/or postgraduate research fellows (PhD students and research-year students).
