# Introduction to scientific computing #

## Aims ##
To provide students with a basic understanding of what is meant by the term "scientific computing", and how it can be implemented in practice.  Such an understanding is the basis for learning a programming language and make reproducible analyses of data.

_Add a few more general aims and motivations, but already pretty good._

## Learning outcomes ##

_Define according to Bloom's Taxonomy (or similar)_, _cf._ ILOs.pdf

Successful completion of the course will enable the student to:

* summarize the main components of a computer and explain the concept of a "file"
    * NB: storage, memory, cpu, (gpu), input devices, output devices, network
* contrast "local" and "network" file systems and formulate use cases for both
    * NB: could be of relevance if talking about large files processed on a remote server 
* use _variables_ in a programming language (python) and perform simple operations (manipulations) on the information (data) they contain
* assess the resources (memory, CPU?) associated with a processing task
    * too advanced?
      * I think it worth mentioning, it is a issue for many.
* write a program to extract information from a file containing data in textual format, and export the collated data to another text file for further processing (statistics, visualisation)
    * Visualization might be to advanced. 

## Content ##

The course runs over three days:

_TODO: Split into 3 days_

* Terminal
* File system
* Interactive v scripts
* Bash
* Memory
* Basic variables
* Advanced variables
* Arithmetic
* Programming concepts

* Example: log files:
    * event: target (in samples).
    * reaction: button press (in samples).
    * calculate reaction time in ms.
    * export long format.
