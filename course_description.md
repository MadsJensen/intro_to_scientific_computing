# Introduction to scientific computing #

## Aims ##
To provide students with a basic understanding of what is meant by the term "scientific computing" and how it can be implemented in practice. Such an understanding is the basis for learning a programming language and make reproducible analyses of data. Further, it will provide the students valueble tools to either continue on another more advanced programming course or self-study. 


_Add a few more general aims and motivations, but already pretty good._

## Learning outcomes ##

_Define according to Bloom's Taxonomy (or similar)_, _cf._ ILOs.pdf

Successful completion of the course will enable the student to:

* Summarize the main components of a computer and explain the concept of a "file"
    * NB: storage, memory, cpu, (gpu), input devices, output devices, network
* Contrast "local" and "network" file systems and formulate use cases for both
    * NB: could be of relevance if talking about large files processed on a remote server 
* Use _variables_ in a programming language (python) and perform simple operations (manipulations) on the information (data) they contain
* Assess the resources (memory, CPU?) associated with a processing task
    * too advanced?
      * MJ: I think it is worth mentioning, it is a issue for many.
* Write a program to extract information from a file containing data in textual format, and export the collated data to another text file for further processing (statistics, visualisation)
    * MJ: visualization might be to advanced. 

## Content ##
The course runs over three days:


[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)

_Thought: Maybe it would be good to talk about "pipes" as a metaphor for linking functions._


**Day 1:**

* What is a computer?
* Terminal
* File system
* Interactive v scripts
* Bash

**Day 2:**

* Memory
* Basic variables
* Advanced variables
* ?? maybe programming concepts 1, i.e. scripts in action
    
**Day 3:**

* Programming concepts 
* Arithmetic
* Log file exercise


**Example: log files:**

* Event: target (in samples).
* Reaction: button press (in samples).
* Calculate reaction time in ms.
* Export in long format.


### Teaching format ###

Lectures (few) and (mostly) hands-on exercises.

### Target audience ###

* Students of any discipline that generates or work with _data_ that needs to be analysed to gain insight into a phenomenon (_a.k.a._ "everybody")
* People interested in the foundations of data-driven science
