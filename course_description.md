# Foundations of data-driven health science

An introduction to data science
The foundations of data-driven inquiry

Introduction to scientific computing

[//]: # (Course [github repo](https://github.com/MadsJensen/intro_to_scientific_computing).)

## Aims ##

To provide students with a basic understanding of what is meant by the term "scientific computing" and how it can be implemented in practice. Such an understanding is the basis for learning a programming language and make reproducible data analyses. Further, it will provide the students with valuable tools to either continue on another, more advanced, programming course, or self-studies.

Start of fall semester 2017, before "_C171/16 Introduction to MATLAB in Neuroimaging_", for which the present course could become the prerequisite. This has already been discussed with Mikkel Bo Hansen.

## Learning outcomes

[//]: # (_Define according to Bloom's Taxonomy (or similar)_, _cf._ ILOs.pdf)
[//]: # (    * NB: storage, memory, CPU, (GPU), input devices, output devices, network)
[//]: # (    * NB: could be of relevance if talking about large files processed on a remote server)

Successful completion of the course will enable the student to:

* Summarize the main components of a computer and relate these to the process of "computing"
* Contrast _textual_ and _binary_ files in terms of their contents and find information in both using tools that can be automated
* Contrast "local" and "network" file systems and formulate use cases for both
* Use _variables_ in a programming language (python) and perform simple operations (manipulations) on the information (data) they contain
* Write a program to extract information from a file containing data in textual format, and export the collated data to another text file for further processing (statistics, visualisation)

### Timetable and program

See [separate document](program.md) for more detailed contents.

### Prerequisites

Participants must bring their own laptop with a hard drive (no Chromebooks or tablet-/surface-type devices are supported). Any reasonably modern (< 5-year-old) Windows, OS X or Linux operating system will do.

### Teaching format

Teaching is in the form of "interactive lectures", where students follow 
instructions to complete specific learning tasks (hands-on) introduced by the lecturers. 

### Target audience

* Students of any discipline that generates or work with _data_ that needs to be analysed to gain insight into a phenomenon
* Students interested in the foundations of data-driven science

### Course material

Will be provided before the beginning of course.

### Language

English

### Involvement/Evaluation

The course alternates between short lectures and hands-on computational problems

### ECTS
To be determined by HEALTH

[//]: # (MJ: isn't this calculated based on the hours the course takes?)

### Criteria for participation

University degree in medicine, dentistry, nursing, or Master's degree in other fields and/or postgraduate research fellows (PhD students and research-year students).

### Head of course
Mads Jensen

### Instructors
* Mads Jensen (CFIN, AU)
* Christopher Bailey (CFIN, AU)
* Teaching assistants: from CFIN PhD student pool

### Number of participants
__To be determined.__ If a large enough locale is made available, perhaps just a large lecture theatre, _we are prepared to open this up to tens of participants, perhaps even up to about 50_!

[//]: # (We may live to regret this...)

### Dates and times

Three days of teaching (Mon, Wed, Fri), possible starting dates:
* Mon 4 September (week 36)
* Mon 11 September (week 37)

### Place
Suitable venue will be determined after enrolment. Auditorium is fine, though flat teaching room slightly preferred.
