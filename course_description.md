# Foundations of data-driven health science

[//]: # (Course [github repo](https://github.com/MadsJensen/intro_to_scientific_computing).)

## Criteria for participation

University degree in medicine, dentistry, nursing, or Master's degree in other fields and/or postgraduate research fellows (PhD students and research-year students).

## Aim ##

Medical professionals and other specialists now have the opportunity to gain insight into physiological mechanisms, both normal and pathological, using data driven analysis strategies that not long ago were only applicable to those with access to supercomputing services. With the proliferation of quantitative research tools, and the simultaneous commoditisation of computational power, comes a need for _all_ researchers to understand the foundations on which scientific computing is based. Such an understanding is the basis for learning a programming language, and enables publication of documented and reproducible data analyses. The aim of the present course is to lay the conceptual foundation with which the student may begin to apply data-driven research practices, and to support her advencement to more specialised topics such as C119: "Stata and Datadocumentation" and C171: "Introduction to MATLAB in Neuroimaging".

## Learning outcomes

[//]: # (_Define according to Bloom's Taxonomy (or similar)_, _cf._ ILOs.pdf)
[//]: # (    * NB: storage, memory, CPU, (GPU), input devices, output devices, network)
[//]: # (    * NB: could be of relevance if talking about large files processed on a remote server)

Successful completion of the course will enable the student to:

* Summarize how the main components of a computer relate to, and constrain, the act of "computing".
* Describe the basic organisation of a file system, and navigate it using commands in a "terminal".
* Contrast _textual_ and _binary_ files in terms of their contents and find information in both using tools that can be automated.
* Contrast local and non-local computing resources and file systems, and formulate use cases for both.
* Use _variables_ in a programming language (python) and perform simple operations (manipulations) on the information (data) they contain.
* Write a program to extract, collate and process information contained in a textual data file, and export it for further processing (statistics, visualisation).

[//]: # (     * MJ: visualization might be to advanced. CJB: agreed)

## Contents 

Teaching is in the form of "interactive lectures", where students follow instructions to complete specific learning tasks (hands-on), after introduction by the lecturers. 

* Day 1: The anatomy of a computer and data
* Day 2: The anatomy and building blocks of a program
* Day 3: Programming as a means to gain insight into data

### Recommended knowledge for participation

No prior knowledge on the topics covered is required. Participants must bring their own laptop with a hard drive (no Chromebooks or tablet-/surface-type devices are supported). Any reasonably modern (< 5-year-old) Windows, OS X or Linux operating system will do.

### Language

English

### Course material

Will be provided before the beginning of course.

### Evaluation

Mandatory assignment (pass/fail, internal examination)

### ECTS
To be determined by HEALTH

[//]: # (MJ: isn't this calculated based on the hours the course takes?)

### Head of course
Mads Jensen (mads@cfin.au.dk)

### Instructors
* Mads Jensen (CFIN, AU)
* Christopher Bailey (CFIN, AU; cjb@cfin.au.dk)
* Teaching assistants: from CFIN PhD student pool

### Number of participants
__To be determined.__ If a large enough locale is made available, perhaps just a large lecture theatre, _we are prepared to open this up to tens of participants, perhaps even up to about 50_!

[//]: # (We may live to regret this...)

### Dates and times

Three days of teaching (Mon, Wed, Fri), possible starting dates:
* Mon 4 September (week 36)
* Mon 11 September (week 37)

### Place
Suitable venue will be determined after enrolment. Auditorium is fine, though flat teaching room slightly preferred.
